	<h1>Time & Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Efficient algorithms are designed to minimize time complexity, ensuring that they execute tasks swiftly, even for large datasets. When evaluating algorithmic efficiency, both time and space complexity play crucial roles, as they determine how efficiently computational resources are utilized. Striking a balance between these complexities is essential for optimizing program performance.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm consumes during its execution. It is denoted as O(n), where 'n' represents the size of the input data. In this context, O(n) signifies that the algorithm's space usage grows linearly with the input size, making it an efficient choice for managing memory resources when dealing with large datasets.</p>
